This package provides a simple solution for the insertion of documentation strings into code. Usage # You can enable this package for a specific major mode: ;; Enable `docstr' inside these major modes. (add-hook 'actionscript-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1))) (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (docstr-mode 1))) Or if you just want to enable it inside a specific buffer just call docstr-mode as a command through the minibuffer: M-x docstr-mode You can also enable this package in all buffers via: (global-docstr-mode 1) Supported Langauges # Here is a list of all languages that are supported by this package: ActionScript C / C++ / C# Golang / Groovy Java / JavaScript / JSX Lua Objective-C PHP / Python Ruby / Rust Scala / Swift TypeScript You can customize the docstr-writers-alist variable to add your own documentation string support for your favourite language. Just add a cons cell like (mode-name . docstr-writer-name) . To create your own documentation string writer, you need to create a function that takes in one argument. For instance: (defun my-docstr-writer (search-string) ;; Insert documentation string here. ) The argument search-string will then be populated by the appropriate trigger function in docstr-trigger-alist . See the variable docstr-trigger-alist for more information. For instance, a C# trigger could look like this: (\"/\" . docstr-trigger-csharp) And the trigger function could look like this: (defun docstr-trigger-csharp (&rest _) \"Trigger document string inside C#.\" (when (and (docstr--doc-valid-p) (looking-back \"///\" 3)) (save-excursion (insert \" <summary>\\n\") (insert \"/// \\n\") (insert \"/// </summary>\")) (forward-line 1) (end-of-line) (docstr--insert-doc-string (docstr--c-style-search-string 2)))) In this example, docstring insertion is triggered only when certain conditions are met; the function docstr--insert-doc-string will be called last of all to insert the actual docstring content. (docstr--c-style-search-string 2) is the search-string passed on to the documentation string writer which writes a proper documentation string based on its information. Before/After Insertion # You can customize documentation before or after the docstring insertion. There are two hooks you can customize: docstr-before-insert-hook docstr-after-insert-hook The use case of this is to provide some kind of set up. For instance, some programming languages would add @desc before an actual description. The following would implement this: (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert \"@desc \"))) Of course, I would recommend you add it locally so it is language specific. Let's try to apply only to TypeScript and only within typescript-mode : (defun my-typescript-mode-hook () (add-hook 'docstr-before-insert-hook (lambda (search-string) (insert \"@desc \")) nil t)) (add-hook 'typescript-mode-hook #'my-typescript-mode-hook) Advanced Implementation # You can also customize documentation strings by running before / after hooks. The following are advanced examples for documentation strings in C++ : Preprocessor Enumerator Structure Class Documentation Strings # You can customize default documentation strings by tweaking these variables. Type Name # docstr-format-type - default: \"{ %s }\" The default is wrap around curly brackets. It only takes one %s for the type name. docstr-show-type-name - default: t If you don't want the type name to be shown; then setting docstr-show-type-name to nil will do the trick. For instance, if you don't want the type name to be shown in java-mode do the following. (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda () (setq-local docstr-show-type-name nil))) docstr-default-typename - default: typename You can change this value if you don't like the default type name. This variable is generally used for programming languages that aren't statically typed like Python , JavaScript , PHP , etc. Variable Name # docstr-format-var - default: \"%s :\" The default is having a colon : at the back of the variable name. It only takes one %s for the variable name. Parameter & Return # docstr-format-param - default: @param #T##V##D# docstr-format-return - default: @return #T##V##D# You can customize these variables for different documentation styles. See the following table for the desciption of the keys #T# , #V# and #D# : Key Description #T# Key represent type name. #V# Key represent variable name. #D# Key represent description. P.S. These variables are constant. Default Descriptions # Here is a list of default description strings that you can customize. These strings are placeholders to remind you to replace these strings with content descriptions. docstr-desc-summary - default to \"[summary]\" . docstr-desc-param - default to \"[description]\" . docstr-desc-return - default to \"[description]\" . docstr-desc-typename - default to \"[type]\" . Faces Configuration # This package provides a way to customize the document string faces in a consistent way, though this is an optional choice. To enable this feature, you can put the following code snippet into your configuration: (docstr-faces-apply) There are three faces that you can customize for documentation strings: docstr-faces-tag-face - Highlight the tag face; like @param , @return , etc. docstr-faces-type-face - Highlight the type name face. docstr-faces-value-face - Highlight the variable name face. Multiline Docstrings & Keys # Make sure you have starting and ending comments before triggering documentation string insertion using this package. For instance, you will need /* and */ before hitting return. There are several packages that can help you achieve this. You can also enable variable docstr-key-support for the built-in support from this package. ;; This fixes auto pairing for documentation strings which fulfill conditions ;; from the multiline documentation string trigger.
